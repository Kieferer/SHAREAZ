# About the project
I created the application for personal use, as I was in a need of a wireless solution of transferring and receiving images and not compressed files on mobile and desktop platforms.
# Used technologies
* C#
* MAUI
> At first the application also had a signing ASP.NET Azure API for transferring files on wide-area network,
> yet its usage not justified its necessity, so I removed the server and revised the 'client' code base.
